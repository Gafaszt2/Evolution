It is Earth's most severe known extinction event, with the extinction of 57% of biological families, 83% of genera, 81% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species. It is also the greatest known mass extinction of insects. It is the greatest of the Big Five mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. There is evidence for one to three distinct pulses, or phases, of extinction."
